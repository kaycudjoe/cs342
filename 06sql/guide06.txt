Guide 6

1. Advanced SQL (Section 7.1, continued) â€” Write sample queries that:

a. Implement an inner join (Section 7.1.6).
SELECT P.firstName, P.lastName, m.title, c.status
FROM ((Movie AS M
JOIN Performer AS P ON c.performerID = p.ID
JOIN Casting AS C ON c.movieID = m.id); 

b. Implement an outer join (Section 7.1.6).
SELECT P.firstName, P.lastName, c.status
FROM (Performer AS P
LEFT OUTER JOIN Casting AS C
ON p.ID = C.performerID);

c. Use an aggregate function (Section 7.1.7).
SELECT MAX (Score) AS Highest_Score, MIN (Score) AS Lowest_Score, 
FROM Movie;

d. Use grouping (Section 7.1.8).
SELECT status, COUNT (*)
FROM Casting
GROUP BY status;
