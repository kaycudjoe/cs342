1. a one-paragraph discussion of where you got your data.
I obtained most of my data from generatedata.com where I entered in the requirements and field names and had random data generated. I did this for all the tables that pertain to Students, Graduate and Employer information. 
For the Staff table, I used real information from the career center. I used information about the 3 career coaches assigned to different students (by industry). 
I also used real information for the YearRequired and the Requirement tables which I obtained from the Calvin LifeWork webpage. This is the link - http://calvin.edu/lifework/

2. one-paragraph discussion identifying/justifying your chosen normal form.
My chosen normal form is the BCNF because it is restrictive enough to ensure that the database is created and works as desired. 

3. demonstration that your schema satisfies your chosen normal form.
Demonstration of BCNF
Functional Dependencies (non-trivial)

Graduate table
ID -> firstName, lastName, email, phoneNumber

Staff table
ID -> firstName, lastName, email, phoneNumber

Student table 
ID -> firstName, lastName, email, phoneNumber, schoolyear, scholarshipreceivedate, graduateID, staffID

Employer table
ID -> firstName, lastName, email, phoneNumber, companyName

YearRequired table
ID -> name, description, requiredYear

Requirement table
ID -> name, yearRequiredID

StudentRequirement table
studentID, requirementID -> yearlevelTaken, scholarship

StudentEmployer table
studentID, employerID -> position, startDate, endDate

GraduateEmployer table
graduateID, employerID -> position

Candidate keys are the IDâ€™s in the tables listed under above as they are unique. 

From the above, the schema is in BCNF. This is because all the left hand sides of the non-trivial functional dependencies are super keys.
