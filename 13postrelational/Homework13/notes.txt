Homework 13

2. 
a. What type of noSQL database system is Oracle’s NoSQL product, KVLite?
Key-value noSQL database system

b. The Internet Movie DataBase (imdb.com) is currently implemented in mySQL. If you were required to port it to a noSQL system, which of the noSQL system types would you suggest? Explain your answer.
I would suggest a Graph database. This is because graph databases are useful for connected data. It provides a two way relationship, so that one can find an actor from a movie, and also find a movie from that actor. You just need to follow the edges between them. 
We can find movies from actors in KVLite when we use our roles major key paths. We however need to define a new major key path for them. 

c. Could you (efficiently) reuse the same key-value structure for exercise 13.1.d (above) and its “opposite”, i.e., get the movies in which a given actor is cast? Why or why not?

d. NoSQL databases are often referred to as schema-less or schema-free. Explain what this means using examples from your homework solution.
