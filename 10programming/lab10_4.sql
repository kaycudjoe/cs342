-- Restart your two SQL*Plus sessions, run the given stored procedure simultaneously in each of them using:

EXECUTE incrementRank(238071, 0.1);
-- Now, determine if it ran correctly. If it does, explain how. If it doesnâ€™t, identify the problem and modify the code so that it does.


/*
This is a lost update problem. Both of the sessions are not isolated, so some of the updates made to the rank are lost. 
It should have resulted in a rank which is increased by 1000, however, it ended with a rank increased by a number less than 1000.

-- Modification
-- This can be modified by adding a lock to the rows which are affected. Over here, a FOR UPDATE clause will be used. This solves the issue as it isolates the session and makes all changes made easily recognizable.
