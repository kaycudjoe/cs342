1. Basic SQL (Section 6.3) — Review basic SQL as needed, then write sample queries that:
a. Use one or more tuple variables (Section 6.3.2).
SELECT P.firstName, P.lastName, C.status
FROM Performer AS P, Casting AS C
WHERE P.lastName = ‘Ford’ AND C.performerid = P.id;

b. Use one or more of the set operations, e.g., UNION, EXCEPT, INTERSECT (Section 6.3.4).
(SELECT P.firstName, P.lastName
FROM Performer AS P
WHERE P.lastName = ‘Hauer’)
UNION
(SELECT P.firstName, P.lastName 
FROM Performer AS P, Casting AS C
WHERE C.performerid = P.id);


2. Advanced SQL (Sections 7.1.1–7.1.5) — This will include more new material; write sample queries that:

a. Select based on a NULL field value (Section 7.1.1).
SELECT *
FROM Performer
WHERE lastName IS NULL; 

b. Implement a nested sub-query, using [NOT] EXISTS, IN, ANY or ALL (Sections 7.1.2–7.1.4).
SELECT P.firstName, P.lastName
FROM Performer AS E
WHERE P.id IN (SELECT C.performerid
		FROM Casting AS C
		WHERE C.performerid = P.id);

c. Implement a correlated sub-query (Section 7.1.3).
SELECT P.firstName, P.lastName
FROM Performer AS P, Casting AS C
WHERE P.id = C.performerid;
