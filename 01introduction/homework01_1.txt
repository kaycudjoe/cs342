Exercise 1.14

- Complete the exercise as written.

a. If the name of the ‘CS’ (Computer Science) Department changes to ‘CSSE’ (Computer Science and Software Engineering) Department and the corresponding prefix for the course number also changes, identify the columns in the database that would need to be updated.
The columns that would need to be updated are:
- The Major column in the STUDENT table 
- The Course_number column and the Department column in the COURSE table
- The Course_number column in Section
- The Course_number column and the prerequisite_number column in the PREREQUISITE table

b. Can you restructure the columns in the COURSE, SECTION, and PREREQUISITE tables so that only one column will need to be updated?
Yes, we can get rid of the prefixes of the course_numbers and just make the course numbers just numbers. Classes can therefore be identified with their departments and course_number. So a class in the Math department will be identified with the Department ‘MATH’ and the course_number ‘2410’. 
In addition to this, the prerequisite table will need to have the prerequisite_number section split too and a department column added to it. 
So a department column will be added to both the SECTION table and the PREREQUISITE table. 
This will leave us with just the department column having to be updated. 

c. In addition, consider whether you can restructure the schema so that only one field needs to be changed. If it’s possible, explain how. If not, explain why not.
It is not possible to restructure the schema so that only one field needs to be changed. We need each column and each table to maintain entity integrity.
