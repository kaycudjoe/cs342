1. Views (Section 7.3, for Monday)

a. Write a simple view specification. For details on Oracle views, see Managing Views.
CREATE VIEW Viewer
AS SELECT title, year
FROM Movie

b. Define the following terms (in the comments of your SQL command file).

i. Base Tables: Tables whose tuples are always physically stored in the database.

ii. Join Views: These are views that specify more than one base table or view in the “FROM” clause.

iii. Updateable Join Views: This is a join view where “UPDATE”, “INSERT” and “DELETE” operations are allowed.

iv. Key-Preserved Tables: These are tables for which every key of the table can also be a key of the result of the join. 

v. Views that are implemented via query modification vs materialization. (For details on Oracle materialization, see Materialized View Concepts and Architecture, focusing on the “What is a Materialized View?” and “Why Use Materialized Views” sections.)
- Query modification: modifying or transforming the view query (submitted by the user) into a query on the underlying base tables.
- View materialization: physically creating a temporary or permanent view table when the view is first queried or created, and keeping that table on the assumption that other queries on the view will follow. 



2. Formal languages for the relational model (Chapter 8, for Wednesday)

a. Relational Algebra (read Sections 8.1–8.3 & 8.5) — Write a simple query on the movies database using SELECT (σcondition), PROJECT (πfieldlist), RENAME (ρnewName) and JOIN (⋈condition) (see example queries 1 & 2 in Section 8.5).

b. Tuple Relational Calculus (read Sections 8.6.1–8.6.3 & 8.6.8) — Write a simple query on the movies database using the tuple relational calculus queries (see example queries 0 & 1 in Section 8.6.4).

c. Define the following terms):

i. Existential and universal quantifiers (see Section 8.6.3).

ii. safe expressions (see Section 8.6.8).

Write your solutions either in ASCII (e.g., SELECT_condition), Unicode (e.g., σcondition) or using hand-writing.
