Exercise 2.2

a. The constraint that requires that all movies having a non-NULL score value must also have more than 1000 votes is:
	CHECK (score IS NULL OR votes > 1000)
	This constraint requires that all movies whose score is a NULL value have any number of votes. For movies whose scores are not NULL, it requires that the number of votes be 1000. 
	
b. Yes, a separate constraint is desirable in several instances. A separate constraint might be desired when you want the constraint to hold true in specific cases. Eg. under specific conditions such as location, time, day, season or such
Also, we might want a separate constraint for easy modifying or deleting as opposed to having to go through the whole schema to get rid of it.
